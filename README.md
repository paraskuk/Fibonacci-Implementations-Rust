# Fibonacci Project

This project provides various implementations of the Fibonacci sequence in Rust, including recursive, memoized, iterative, and dynamic programming approaches. It also includes performance measurement and parallel computation using the `rayon` crate.

## Implementations

- `fibonacci`: A simple recursive implementation.
- `fibonacci_match`: A recursive implementation using pattern matching.
- `fibonacci_dp`: An implementation using dynamic programming.
- `fibonacci_memo`: A memoized recursive implementation.
- `fibonacci_iterative`: An iterative implementation.

## Usage

### Running the Program

To run the program, use the following command:

```sh
cargo run
